def process_harm_expanded(harm_annotation):
    """
    Parse an expanded harmonic annotation, as defined by Trevor and David, to
    extract chord, time signature, and local key annotations together with their
    timing information: [measure, measure offset, duration, value]. This is done
    as the timed-chord annotations released by the authors are temporally not
    consistent due to potential bugs in the `expand6` function. Measure offsets
    are expressed in relation to the position of each chord/key in the measure,
    thus ranging in the [0, 1) interval.

    Parameters
    ----------
    harm_annotation : str
        String representation of the harmonic annotation or file path.
    
    Returns
    -------
    chords : list of lists
        The chord annotations, where local keys and roman numerals are merged.
    time_signatures : list of lists
        The extracted time signatures, with timing information as for chords.
    keys : list of lists
        The extracted local keys, with timing information as for chords.

    Notes
    -----
        - Currently, time signatures are not returned (None is given).
        - Not all special symbols / characters are supported.
        - Chords are repeated when they should be sustained.
