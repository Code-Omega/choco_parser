# ChoCo
The Chord Corpus

ChoCo is a large dataset providing chord annotations of scores and tracks that were collected, integrated, and semantically enriched from a number of repositories and databases â€” redistributed for personal or research use only. The project also provides a family of tools for chord parsing and manipulation, together with the data transformation pipeline needed to include new chord datasets in ChoCo.
