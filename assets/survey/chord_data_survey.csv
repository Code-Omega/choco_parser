From my point of view, it is necessary to conceive the possibility to have different annotations of the same corpus coexist, these annotations answering different questions and adopting different points of view. The major problem is that these points of view are not just complementary, they can be contradictory and cancel each other out, hence the need to keep track of how they were produced, with what theoretical presuppositions, for what purposes, etc. I'm sure you've thought about this, but I think we should try to take it into account more directly if the tool has the ambition to attract musicologists and analysts and if it has the ambition to assist them in their work.
