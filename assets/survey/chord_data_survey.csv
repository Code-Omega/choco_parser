But interesting research ideas have often arisen in my mind, such as:  what genres of music deploy extensions; how does progression relate to genre, or period; etc.  On the other hand as an ethnomusicologist I also recognize that the concept of ""chord"" isn't relevant to all musics, so maybe what is required is polyphonic symbolic representation of many kinds of music, derived either from audio or from various notational representations (lead sheet, score, tabs...), without assuming adherence to a 12ET gamut; from this data chord information could be gleaned. Of course if chords are already firmly embedded in the style - for instance lead sheets and charts emblazoned with chord symbols - then this information would be included.

From my point of view, it is necessary to conceive the possibility to have different annotations of the same corpus coexist, these annotations answering different questions and adopting different points of view. The major problem is that these points of view are not just complementary, they can be contradictory and cancel each other out, hence the need to keep track of how they were produced, with what theoretical presuppositions, for what purposes, etc. I'm sure you've thought about this, but I think we should try to take it into account more directly if the tool has the ambition to attract musicologists and analysts and if it has the ambition to assist them in their work. My somewhat hesitant answers above are linked to this state of affairs.    "
